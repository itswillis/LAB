Summer is over and the hot days are gone
Bushes shrubs and trees are parched 
The grass is brown and everything waits for rain
It has been dry for half a year
Last spring, a Tortoise mother carefully prepared the nest for her five eggs
After closing and concealing the hole her duties were ended and she left
Now it is autumn the Tortoise eggs are fully developed and ready to hatch
